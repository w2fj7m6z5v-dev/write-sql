description: Use when the user wants to沉淀 CDAP/write-query SQL business cases into the write-query skill, especially from docs SQL案例 folders. Guides one-case-at-a-time analysis, user confirmation, and careful updates to ROUTING, TABLE_INDEX, FIELD_BACKFILL, RULES, or verified-cases without blindly copying工单 SQL.

# SQL Case Sedimentation

把 CDAP SQL 工单案例逐条拆成可复用的 `write-query` 技能知识。核心原则：**案例是证据，不是知识本身**；进入技能的是稳定的找表、补表、口径和审计规则。

## When Triggered

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- 从 SQL 案例、工单脚本、案例文件夹中“沉淀/迭代/升级 write-query 技能”。
- 一个案例一个案例分析，先确认再写入技能。
- 总结“啥场景找啥表”、补表规则、SQL 审计规则。

Also use it when the user says类似“案例沉淀”“把案例迭代进技能”“先跟我确认再沉淀”。

## Grounding

Before asking the user anything:

1. Read the target SQL case or case folder index.
2. Read only the needed `write-query` references:
   - `ROUTING.md` for scene-to-table routing.
   - `TABLE_INDEX.md` and matching `tables/*.md` for candidate tables.
   - `FIELD_BACKFILL.md` for missing-field joins.
   - `RULES.md` for SQL audit rules.
   - `verified-cases/INDEX.md` only when a complex reusable flow may warrant a case.
3. Check whether the knowledge already exists. Do not duplicate an existing rule under a new name.
4. Check whether the case can already be implemented by existing general `write-query` routing, field backfill, and audit rules. If yes, do not propose new sedimentation; explain the reusable path and any case-specific parameters or口径 that still need confirmation.

## One-Case Confirmation Protocol

Process **one SQL case at a time**. Do not update skill files before the user confirms that case.

For each case, respond in this exact shape:

```text
案例 X：{short title}

源文件：
{path}

我准备沉淀的内容：

1. 用户会怎么问
- ...

2. 应识别的业务场景
- ...

3. 主表路由
- 场景事实在：...
- 应找：...
- 不应找：...

4. 补表规则
- 缺口字段：...
- 补表：...
- JOIN：...
- 必要过滤：...
- 行数风险：...

5. 关键口径 / 过滤 / 审计
- ...

6. 我建议写入
- ROUTING.md：...
- TABLE_INDEX.md / tables/*.md：...
- FIELD_BACKFILL.md：...
- RULES.md：...
- verified-cases：...

7. 不应沉淀
- 一次性附件表：...
- 单客户 / 单项目 / 单批编码：...
- 不稳定 SQL 写法：...

需要你确认：
- ...
```

Wait for user confirmation. If the user corrects a rule, update the proposed sedimentation before editing files.

If the case is fully covered by existing general rules, respond with the case title, source file, the existing route that can implement it, the remaining parameters to confirm, and explicitly state that no skill files need to be updated.

## What To Sediment

Prefer stable, reusable knowledge:

- **ROUTING.md**: user language → business scene → primary fact table.
- **TABLE_INDEX.md + tables/*.md**: stable tables that should be discoverable by future agents.
- **FIELD_BACKFILL.md**: missing-field join paths, keys, required filters, row-count risks.
- **RULES.md**: generation/review rules such as attachment handling, de-duplication, time windows, month pivoting, sensitive-field masking.
- **verified-cases/**: only complex, high-reuse flows where a rule row is insufficient.

The most important capability is **finding the right table by business scene**, not accumulating scripts.

## What Not To Sediment

Do not write these into runtime knowledge as stable rules:

- One-off attachment table names such as `zone_gz_yz_*`.
- Single customer names, phone numbers, project names, one-time网点/销售品/参数 lists.
- Broken SQL syntax copied from a case.
- A parameter code, product code, or status code unless the user confirms it is a reusable business口径 or it is already verified elsewhere.
- Full scripts inside `RULES.md`; use concise rules or a `verified-case` only when needed.
- Cases that can already be implemented by existing general rules. For these, keep the runtime knowledge unchanged and only explain which existing route/table/rule handles the需求.

## Editing Workflow After Confirmation

After the user confirms a case:

1. Edit `.agents/skills/write-query` first.
2. Keep changes scoped to the confirmed case.
3. Add a table document only when the user confirmed the table is stable enough for `TABLE_INDEX.md`.
4. Sync `.agents` to `.claude` with:

```bash
bash scripts/sync_skills.sh sync agents --force
```

5. Verify:

```bash
bash scripts/sync_skills.sh check
python3 .agents/skills/write-query/scripts/lint_metric_index.py --index .agents/skills/write-query/references/METRIC_INDEX.md
```

6. Report exactly what changed and what remains uncommitted. Do not include unrelated files.

## Multi-Case Runs

For a folder of cases:

1. Create or update a review matrix first if none exists.
2. Then proceed case by case using the confirmation protocol.
3. Do not batch-write multiple cases unless the user explicitly changes from “逐案确认” to “分批确认”.

Useful matrix columns:

```text
案例 -> 用户会怎么问 -> 场景标签 -> 主表路由 -> 补表规则 -> 关键过滤 -> 写入位置 -> 不应沉淀 -> 待确认
```
